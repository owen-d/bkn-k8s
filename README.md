### Bkn-k8s

This is a small metadata repository which contains some utilities helpful in bootstrapping a kubernetes cluster. Currently it only has [kube-lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego) (a service for automatically registering & renewing ssl certs via [ACME protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-07) & [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) & some debugging utilities.
